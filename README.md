# ProjectFiniteElements
 Matlab script for Finite Element Project.
 # Actually Implemented:
Diffusion-Convection-Reaction Equations P1 and P2
Mass Lumping
SUPG
Implicit Euler method for Parabolic Equation (both P1 and P2)
Crank-Nicolson method for Parabolic Equation (both P1 and P2)
# Soon Implemented
Finite Element Hermetian P3
Domain Decomposition
